{"name":"BSM: Bayesian Selectivity Modelling","tagline":"An R package for modelling the size-selectivity of fishing gear","body":"# Purpose\r\n\r\nThis package was developed to assist researchers in fitting size-selectivity models to experimental trawl data. The models are fit using Bayesian models which are highly flexible and at least as useful as the traditionally used frequentist models (such as GLM's and GLMMS).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation and basic usage\r\n\r\nTo install, you'll need to have make sure you can install and run [`R2jags`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R2jags/index.html). Once you have that set up, you can install `BSM`. Here's how that's done using [`devtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html):\r\n```{r}\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"tmelliott/bsm\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage is fairly straightforward, and is fairly similar to most modelling syntax.\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(BSM)\r\ndata <- data.frame(len = seq(5, 20, by = 1),\r\n                   y   = c(0, 1, 1, 0, 4, 6, 15, 23, 26, 38, 38, 28, 59, 37, 24, 13),\r\n                   n   = c(3, 5, 8, 12, 19, 15, 20, 26, 29, 40, 39, 28, 59, 37, 24, 13))\r\n\r\n## Define a data object and plot it:\r\ndat <- bsmData(y1 = y, n = n, length = len, data = data)\r\nplot(dat)\r\n\r\n## Fit a selectivity model:\r\nfit <- bsm(dat)\r\nsummary(fit)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe best resource is currently Chapter 7 of my [Masters Thesis](http://tomelliott.co.nz/assets/docs/tomelliott-masters.pdf), or else you can read up on the various arguments to the main functions,\r\n```{r}\r\n?bsmData\r\n?bsm\r\n```\r\n\r\n# To do\r\n\r\n- fix up implementation of factors to enable easy \"no intercept\" model for various parameters, `L50 ~ mesh + haul - 1`","google":"UA-69555072-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
