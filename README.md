BSM: Bayesian Selectivity Modelling
===================================

([view website](http://tmelliott.github.io/bsm))

An R package for the analysis of experimental trawl surveys using Bayesian (heirarchical)
models. The interface allows different binomial and poisson likelihoods, and several
parametric and non-parametric selection curves.

This project is a work-in-progress, as part of my MSc Thesis.
